# Case
While working on our group project, we noticed that one particular group member called Sem made a lot of random noises and weird quotes while on Discord,
seemingly out of nowhere. The rest of the group quickly got used to this. But what would happen if Sem got sick? We wouldn't survive without his ear penetrating harsh sounds and quotes.
That's when I came up with the idea for SemBot

## SemBot
SemBot Is a node Discord bot which simulates Sem being in your voice channel. The bot can come into your voice channel and play random files at random intervals.
